# TODO List for Ecommerce Product Cards Update

## Tasks
- [x] Reduce product image size in ProductCard.css (change height from 200px to 150px and object-fit to contain)
- [x] Add 'Shoes' to categories array in App.jsx
- [x] Import additional images in App.jsx (laptop2.jpg, laptop3.jpg, phone2.jpg, bags.jpg, shoe.jpg, shoes.jpg)
- [x] Add new product cards to initialProducts in App.jsx using the new images (including shoes products)

## Followup
- [x] Run the app to verify changes: smaller images, more cards, shoes category and cards added, no repeated images
